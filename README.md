I have given generalised activities for destination as for the particular destination activites a data/worldcities.csv file will be required.
Using real place names reliably requires external services such as Google Places, OpenStreetMap, or Large Language Models (LLMs).
To ensure the application runs:

completely offline,

without API keys,

without rate limits or costs,


the system uses a rule-based itinerary engine instead.
Focus on Planning Logic, Not Data Dependency

The goal of this project is to demonstrate travel planning logic, including:

day-wise itinerary structuring,

non-repetitive activity scheduling,

cost estimation based on duration and group size,

route visualization.
